# Iris_flower_classification



The Iris Flower Classification is a popular machine learning problem where the objective is to classify iris flower species based on the physical dimensions of their petals and sepals. The dataset used for this classification contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

The dataset typically includes four features:

Sepal Length: The length of the sepal (in centimeters).
Sepal Width: The width of the sepal (in centimeters).
Petal Length: The length of the petal (in centimeters).
Petal Width: The width of the petal (in centimeters).
These four features are used to classify the flowers into one of the three species.
